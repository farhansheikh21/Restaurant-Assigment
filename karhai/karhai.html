    <p>Chicken Karahi is a delicious and vibrant dish originating from Pakistan. It typically features:

        * **Bold flavors:** Ginger, garlic, and tomatoes are prominent ingredients, creating a base rich in taste.
        * **Spicy kick:** Green chilies add a pleasant heat, but the level of spice can be adjusted to your preference. 
        * **Succulent chicken:** Traditionally cooked with bone-in pieces for extra flavor, but boneless options are also popular.
        * **Thick gravy:** The tomatoes are usually stewed down to create a thick and flavorful sauce that coats the rice or naan perfectly. 
        
        Here's a quick rundown of the cooking process:
        
        1. **Marinate or sear the chicken** for added depth of flavor.
        2. **Saut√© aromatics** like ginger, garlic, and onions.
        3. **Add tomatoes and spices** to simmer and create the base sauce.
        4. **Cook the chicken** in the fragrant sauce.
        5. **Garnish with fresh ingredients** like cilantro and green chilies for an extra pop of flavor.
        
        Chicken Karahi is enjoyed with rice or naan for a satisfying and flavorful meal.</p>
